# Java Exercises
Welcome to my collection of Java exercises. <br />
This folder contains exercises that I developed during my training course at Randstad Academy.<br />
The exercises were done in 4 hours, no more nor less.<br />
<br />
The initial exercises are largely incomplete and are here solely to demonstrate my growth journey, from difficulties in managing my time, to working in a team, to finally completing a well-documented mini project.

# Index of Exercises (Mini Projects)

IDE for Java (optional but recommended).<br />
